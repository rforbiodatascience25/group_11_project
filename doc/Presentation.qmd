## Introduction to Subject

*R. intestinalis* survives post-glucose (and post-mucin-degradation products) depletion by entering a slow-growth mode.

A combination of targeted metabolomics and RNA-seq showed that the slow growth mode of *R. intestinalis* represents a diauxic shift towards acetate and lactate consumption (both leading to butyrate production).

*R. intestinalis* consistently increased the expression of genes involved in glycolysis, pyruvate utilization, mucin hydrolysis, galactose and mannose utilization, and the butyrate-producing process after depletion of glucose/pyruvate.

## Data Cleaning and Augmentation

## Analysis Results: Co-Expression

::::: columns
::: column
-   Input data was a total of 9 samples across 3 time conditions (with 3 replicates each)
-   Matrix reveals co-expression patterns in *R. intestinalis* gene expression data
-   Co-regulated genes can potentially contribute to the same pathways

## Analysis Results: Clustering

::::: columns
::: column
-   K-means clustering was applied to the correlation matrix from the previous slide
-   There is a clear separation of genes in the 2D space
-   Genes are grouped into 3 clusters (arbitrary cutoff for regulation validation)

## Top KO Codes per Cluster

::::: columns
::: column
-   Annotation o*f R. intestinalis* genome enables matching of Gene ids with KO terms
-   Mapping of KO terms to pathways enables the calculation of pathways percentages across clusters
-   As expected, some pathways are represented across all clusters, whereas others are limited to 1 or 2 clusters.
